This project demonstrates how to build a spam detection system using Logistic Regression in Python. It involves the following steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Load email data from a CSV file.
Handle missing values.
Perform label encoding to represent spam as 0 and ham as 1.
Feature Extraction:

Utilize TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
Remove stop words and convert text to lowercase for better feature representation.
Model Training:

Train a Logistic Regression model on the labeled data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on both training and testing datasets using metrics such as accuracy.

Accuracy on training data = 96.70%

Accuracy on test data = 96.59%


Prediction:

Build a system to predict whether new emails are spam or ham based on the trained model.
This project showcases a basic implementation of a spam detection system using machine learning.
